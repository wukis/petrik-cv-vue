              Experienced software engineer with a demonstrated history of
              working in the web development industry and a Bachelor's degree
              focused in Software Engineering. Skilled in: PHP (Laravel,

              I believe that anyone can fix a problem or develop a specific
              solution, but my 8+ years of experience as a full stack developer
              has taught me beyond this. Don't just build around clients
              requirements and patch barely working system, but design a
              solution that is scalable, flexible, reliable and maintainable,
              open for interoperability and longstanding.
            </p>
